# NiagaraFractalTree

Fractal tree(Fibonacci tree) implementation in Unreal Engine 5 Niagara(GPU Simulation Stage).

Demo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwkOcX-4uI

Line drawing still does not work well in preview.

Also, there are still some weak parts in this implementation and it is not optimized.
